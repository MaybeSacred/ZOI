Tripod or trilaterally symmetrical enemies
Giantass worm - worlm? whirm? Soft textures, see "Velvet worm"
Possibly implement second movement mode, with detached body from camera heading so that strafing is possible. 
This should be toggleable so that each mode is useful for different situations or so that sideways controls cause the tank to turn towards that direction for strafing
Flying enemies - Plenty since they are easy, good place to make use of trilateralism
Background story
At the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station, when something something something happens
Something - An alien ship crashes, although maybe reports are of a meteor first? or an earthquake of great 
magnitude occurs near the south pole, whichever; a team from the base is sent out in a tracked vehicle. This seems like
it could be a first level, or maybe an introductory cinematic
Earthquake should originate from Pole of Inaccessibility, it sounds quite cool and is quite difficult to get to
This also leads to one level being named Inaccessible, or Access
The crew is killed with some video footage sent back
Enter you, with a well-equipped tank for the arctic conditions. 
You start to encounter some of these strange alien beings' constructs and defenses
First few enemies should have feel of constuctors/builders and scouts
Later, more advanced, stronger guarding units
Then you find the source complex, maybe they were underground arctic dwellers, or truly aliens
Some lightning gates, or keep the design seemingly organic, like ice that melts. Maybe meld between these two themes as the player approaches the end
Same way with overall level design, should become rockier and more broken up as the player reaches the end, more difficult enemies and surprises, mines, "natural" obstacles
Psychedelic elements should intensify, the overall idea is that the player is slowly dying of hypothermia
All of these effects should work together
Nano swarms

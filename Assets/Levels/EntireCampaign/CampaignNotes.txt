Fog is going to get progressively weaker as the game progresses.

Stays the Same Throughout
	Fog Mode                Exponential
	Linear Fog Start        100
	Linear Fog End          4000
	Skybox Material         Eerie2_skybox
	Halo Strength           Undecided
	Flare Strength          Undecided
	Flare Fade Speed        Undecided

Ambient Light goes from (100,100,100) at the beginning
	to (0,0,0) when the player enters the cave

Start Campaign - Opening
	Fog Density	0.01

Beginning of Flatlakes
